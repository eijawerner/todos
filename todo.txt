OBS! something wrong when setting up useSubscription in todoRow. See console.error

style:
- restyle inputs, remove blue border, other way to indicate focus?
- cleanup inline styles
- custom style checkboxes
- change background of todorows to something else than white?

functionality:
- use subscriptions instead of poll (https://neo4j.com/docs/graphql-manual/current/subscriptions/)
- prevent autofill suggestions of new form!
- better error handling when tries to save lists with same name
- error handling in general
- way to delete or edit name of list
- list id, url with list id? redirect after list is created?
- (add debounce)
- add favicon
